   <h2>Listen</h2><b title="About Earth 🌎"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"> Earth</a></b> is extremely tired, and honestly, she has every right to be. <strong>For over 4.5 billion years, she has been spinning in space like a perfectly balanced dancer, never missing a beat, never asking for a break, and never sending a complaint email to the universe.</strong> She provides humans with air, water, food, mountains, oceans, forests, sunsets, rain, and even Wi-Fi signals that somehow travel through her atmosphere. Yet instead of being thanked daily, she is blamed for being “too hot,” “too cold,” “too rainy,” or “too boring.” Imagine giving someone oxygen for free and still hearing them say, “Ugh, this air is annoying today.” That is Earth’s life in a nutshell. <br>

Humans love to act surprised when the weather changes, as if Earth personally wakes up every morning and decides, “Yes, today I will ruin everyone’s plans.” When it rains, people complain. When it is sunny, people complain. When it snows, people complain. When it is windy, people complain. Earth is starting to think that no matter what she does, someone will always say, “This is not my favorite climate.” She tries her best to balance seasons perfectly, but humans still act like she is running a broken thermostat. <sup>3</sup> Somewhere deep inside her core, Earth is screaming, “I am a planet, not your personal air-conditioning system!”
<hr>

Earth also finds humans very confusing. They invented airplanes that can cross the world in hours, phones that can talk to space, and machines that can drive themselves, yet they still argue about simple things like whether the planet is round. Earth watches these debates in silence, slowly rotating, wondering how a species living on her surface can question her shape while literally using satellites that orbit her. Sometimes she wants to send a notification: <u>“Hi, you are standing on me. I am not flat. Please relax.” But she remains polite, because Earth has patience that humans can only dream of</u>.
<br>

Then there is pollution. Earth did not sign up to be a giant trash can, yet humans treat her like one. <mark>Plastic bags float in her oceans like sad jellyfish, smoke covers her skies like a permanent bad filter, and oil spills make her seas cry black tears.</mark> Humans throw garbage away and say, <u>“It’s gone,” but Earth knows the truth: nothing is really gone when you live on a closed system planet. Every bottle, every wrapper, every piece of trash comes back to her like an unwanted boomerang. She is basically running the world’s biggest recycling project without any salary.</u>
<br><br>

<strong>Earth also finds it funny how humans chase technology while forgetting nature.</strong> People scroll for hours, watching videos of beaches, forests, and waterfalls, even though those things exist outside their windows. <del>Earth is like, “You could literally walk outside and see this in real life.</del> <u>” But no, humans prefer 4K videos of sunsets instead of actual sunsets. They will travel across the world to take a photo, only to spend the rest of the trip staring at their phones, editing the same photo. Earth watches this and shakes her tectonic plates in confusion.</u>
<hr>

<b><mark>Despite all this, Earth still loves humans. She gives them rain when they are thirsty, soil when they want to grow food, and gentle breezes when the day is too hot.</mark> </b>She paints the sky orange and pink every evening like a free art show, and nobody even tips her. She lets flowers bloom, birds sing, waves crash, and stars shine, creating beauty everywhere. Even after being treated badly, she never stops giving. She never posts dramatic messages, never blocks anyone, and never deletes her account. She simply keeps spinning, hoping humans will eventually grow up. <br>

Earth has survived dinosaurs, asteroids, ice ages, and massive volcanic eruptions, so she knows she will survive humans too. The real question is whether humans will survive themselves. Earth is not angry; she is just disappointed. <u>She is waiting for the day when people finally realize that she is not a resource to use up, but a home to care for. Until then, she will continue doing what she has always done: floating through space, glowing under the sun, quietly carrying billions of dramatic, confused, funny, and sometimes wonderful humans on her surface.</u> 🌍💚
